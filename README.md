# ArgumentParser instance → manual page

Avoid documenting your Python script arguments on two places!  This is typically
done in an [argparse.ArgumentParser][ap-docs] help configuration (`help=`,
`description=`, etc.), and also in a manually crafted manual page.

The good thing about an `ArgumentParser` objects is that it actually provides
a traversable "tree-like" structure, with all the necessary info needed to
**automatically generate** documentation, for example in a *groff* typesetting
system (manual pages).  And this is where this project can help.

There are two supported ways to generate the manual, either script it using the
installed command `argparse-manpage`, or via `setup.py build` automation (with a
slight bonus of automatic manual page installation with `setup.py install`).


## What is need?

Most of the (meta)data is stored in the `ArgumentParser` object, therefore
`argparse-manpage` needs to know its location—it can be either the object
itself, or a method to call to get the object [^1].

On top of this, several manual page fields (like *author* or *project* name)
need to be specified, either on command-line or via `setup.py` metadata.


## Command-line usage

See the following example:

```
$ argparse-manpage --pyfile ./pythonfile.py --function get_parser \
                   --author "John --author-email doe@example.com" \
                   --project-name myproject --url https://pagure.io/myproject \
> cool-manpage.1
```

This (a) processes the `./pythonfile.py`, (b) calls the `get_parser` inside to
obtain the `ArgumentParser` instance, (c) transforms it into a manual page and
(d) stores it into the `cool-manpage.1` file.

Alternatively those options above can be combined with

- option `--module mymodule.main`, to load a Python module `mymodule.main`
  from `PYTHONPATH`, or
- `--object parser_object_name` if the `parser_object_name` is a global
  variable.


## Use with setup.py

First, you need to declare that `setup.py` uses an external package in your
`pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["argparse-manpage[setuptools]"]
```

Alternatively you can place the `build_manpages` (sub)directory from this
project somewhere onto `PYTHONPATH` so you can use it in `setup.py`.  For
example:

```bash
git submodule add --name build_manpages https://github.com/praiskup/build_manpages
git submodule update --init
```

In your `setup.py` use pattern like:

```python
[...]
from build_manpages import build_manpages, get_build_py_cmd, get_install_cmd

setup(
  [...]
  cmdclass={
      'build_manpages': build_manpages,
      # Re-define build_py and install commands so the manual pages
      # are automatically re-generated and installed
      'build_py': get_build_py_cmd(),
      'install': get_install_cmd(),
  }
)
```

And in the `setup.cfg` configure the manual pages you want to automatically
generate and install:

```
[build_manpages]
manpages =
    man/foo.1:object=parser:pyfile=bin/foo.py
    man/bar.1:function=get_parser:pyfile=bin/bar
    man/baz.1:function=get_parser:pyfile=bin/bar:prog=baz
```

The format of those lines is a colon separated list of arguments/options.  The
first argument determines the filename of the generated manual page.  Then
follows a list of options of format `option=value`.  Supported values are:

- pyfile - what python file the argparse object resides in
- object - the name of arparse object in "pyfile" to import
- function - the name of function in pyfile to call to get the argparse object
- format - format of the generated man page: `pretty` (default), `single-commands-section`
- author - author of the program; can be specified multiple times
- description - description of the program, used in the NAME section, after the
    leading 'name - ' part, see man (7) man-pages for more info
- project_name - name of the project the program is part of
- version - version of the project, visible in manual page footer
- prog - value that substitutes %prog in ArgumentParser's usage
- url - link to project download page
- manual_section - section of the manual, by default 1, see man (7) man-pages
    for more info about existing sections
- manual_title - the title of the manual, by default "Generated Python Manual",
    see man (7) man-pages for more instructions

The values from setup.cfg override values from setup.py's setup().


Then run `setup.py build_manpages` to build a manpages for your project.  Also,
if you used `get_build_py` helper, `setup.py build` then transitively builds the
manual pages.


## Installation

This package is distributed [in PyPI][pypi-page], can be installed by:

    $ pip install argparse-manpage

It can simply downloaded, or distributed as a git submodule (see above).


## Packaging status

The Git snapshot RPMs–pre-release version automatically built from the `main`
branch–are available in Fedora Copr build system

[![build status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/praiskup/argparse-manpage-ci/package/argparse-manpage/status_image/last_build.png)](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/praiskup/argparse-manpage-ci/)

The `argparse-manpage` project is provided natively on many distributions:

![build status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/argparse-manpage.svg?exclude_unsupported=1&header=argparse-manpage)

Try your package manager directly (e.g. on Fedora `dnf install -y
argparse-manpage`).


## History

The initial code was developed for CrunchyFrog, a database query tool for Gnome.
The [frog] is now retired and [RunSQLRun] is it's successor.  Then, the
`build_manpage` command was developed in [andialbrecht] and edited slightly
in [gabrielegiammatteo].  There's even an [old blog post] about this command.

Since some useful work has been done in [python pull request], the code from the
PR has been used here too.

Later more options and flexibility has been implemented in this fork, with the
help of many contributors.  Thank you!

Historically, `build_manpage` setup.py command was provided (mostly for
`OptionParser`).  Later we migrated to more versatile `build_manpages` command.
But the old variant is still [supported](examples/old\_format/README.md).

[^1]: `argparse-manpage` needs to process the location (file/module) via Python
      interpreter, and thus please avoid side-effects (typically, the `main.py`
      files need to use the `if __name__ == "__main__"` condition, and similar).
